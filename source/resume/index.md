- Email: zhengruobing@cnic.cn

## Area of Focus: 
Computer Vision, Machine learning, Statistical modeling and its application in biological conservation

## Biography
- I am a Ph.D student in in eScience technology and application laboratory, CNIC. We mainly focus on utilizing computer technology and statistical model in the field of ecology conservation among several National Nature Reserves in China, such as the waterfowl protection in Qinghai Lake, Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
- Our researches mostly concentrates on the data collection and data mining. We have precisely recorded the waterfowl's GPS trajectories between 2008-2010, so previously our work was mainly focusing on mining valuable patterns from GPS locations.  
- Recently we have collected lots of HD surveillance videos through deploying many webcamera in several typical bird habitats around Qinghai Lake. So I have paid more attention on the Computer Vision field, like dectection, tracking, and some other theories and applications of deep neural network.
